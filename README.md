AI Face Detection Project
Overview
This project utilizes OpenCV to detect faces in real-time using a webcam. It enhances the basic face detection functionality by saving detected faces as images in a dedicated folder.

Key Features
Real-time face detection using OpenCV's haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml.
Draws bounding boxes around detected faces.
Saves detected face images in a directory for further analysis.
Runs until the user presses the 'a' key.

Enhancements
Added a feature to save detected faces as separate images.
Ensured proper directory management to store images.
Used a counter to avoid overwriting saved images.
